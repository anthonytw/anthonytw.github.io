His research interests lie in the development and control of soft robotic systems, including actuators, sensors, and the use of smart materials, especially in the biomedical and healthcare domains. In particular, his work aims to explore the potential of tunable-friction materials to enhance the functionality of robotic systems.
Anthony is a computer engineer by training. Prior to joining the doctoral program he worked as an embedded software engineer at Lockheed Martin where he was involved in the development of autonomous defense systems. Later he served as a senior research analyst and programmer in the Auton Lab at Carnegie Mellon University where his work spanned multiple domains including medical diagnostics, radionuclide detection, and counter human trafficking.</subtitle><author><name>Anthony Wertz</name><email>me@mail.anthonywertz.com</email></author></feed>
